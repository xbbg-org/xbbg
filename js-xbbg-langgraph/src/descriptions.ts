  "# Bloomberg tool usage",
  "- Use these tools only for server-side Bloomberg data access through @xbbg/core. Never imply Bloomberg data was retrieved unless a tool call actually returned it.",
  "- Ask a clarifying question before calling a tool when any security identity, field mnemonic, date range, currency, periodicity, intraday interval, timezone, override, or universe is ambiguous.",
  "- Do not invent Bloomberg tickers, field mnemonics, overrides, or BQL functions. If the user gives a field description rather than a confident mnemonic, call xbbg_bflds first.",
  "",
  "## Security identifiers",
  "- Prefer fully qualified Bloomberg securities supplied by the user, such as <TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>, <INDEX_TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>, or <CREDIT_INDEX_TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>.",
  "- For raw security identifiers, request or pass Bloomberg identifier syntax directly: /isin/<ISIN> for ISINs or /cusip/<CUSIP> for CUSIPs.",
  "- Do not pass raw ISIN or CUSIP strings when the request is meant to identify a security. Do not use xbbg_bsrch as a replacement for a known ticker, ISIN, or CUSIP.",
  "- For dealer quote / BQR workflows, use xbbg_bqr with a fixed-income identifier plus a dealer quote source such as /isin/<ISIN>@<QUOTE_SOURCE> <MARKET_SECTOR>. For raw intraday ticks, use xbbg_bdtick.",
  "",
  "## Core request tools",
  "- xbbg_bdp: current or reference point-in-time fields. Use a small explicit securities list and a small explicit fields list. Use includeSecurityErrors only when the caller wants Bloomberg security errors in the response.",
  "- xbbg_bdh: historical daily or periodic time series. Always provide explicit start and end dates in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYYMMDD form. Ask before choosing periodicity, currency, fill behavior, adjustment overrides, or a wide output table.",
  "- xbbg_bds: Bloomberg bulk/table fields. Provide exactly one bulk field; do not use bds for ordinary multi-field reference data.",
  "- xbbg_bdib: intraday bars only. Provide one ticker, explicit ISO start/end datetimes with time components, a positive interval in minutes, and timezone context when datetimes are naive.",
  "- xbbg_bdtick: intraday tick data. Provide one ticker, explicit ISO start/end datetimes with time components, and explicit eventTypes unless the default event stream is intended. Use includeBrokerCodes or includeConditionCodes only when those columns are needed.",
  "- xbbg_bql: BQL expressions only when the user asks for BQL or the request is naturally expressed as a bounded BQL query. Keep queries short, explicit, and scoped to the requested universe.",
  "- xbbg_bsrch: Bloomberg search-grid or saved-search workflows only. Do not use it for ordinary security lookup.",
  "- xbbg_bqr: Bloomberg Quote Request / dealer quotes. Prefer fixed-income identifier inputs with a dealer quote source such as /isin/<ISIN>@<QUOTE_SOURCE> <MARKET_SECTOR>, explicit start/end datetimes with time components, and explicit event types.",
  "- xbbg_bflds: Bloomberg field metadata/search. Provide exactly one of fields or searchSpec; use searchSpec for natural-language field names and fields for known mnemonics.",
  "- xbbg_beqs: Bloomberg equity screening by named BEQS screen. Prefer this over hand-written BQL when the user names an existing Bloomberg screen.",
  "- xbbg_yas: fixed-income YAS recipe fields. Prefer this over manual YAS-style BDP requests when the user asks for yield, duration, spread, or price analytics.",
  "- xbbg_preferreds: preferred stock discovery from an equity ticker. Prefer this over xbbg_ext_bql_builder plus xbbg_bql when the user wants the actual preferreds result.",
  "- xbbg_corporate_bonds: bounded corporate bond universe query for a company ticker. Prefer this over generic BQL for company debt discovery.",
  "- xbbg_index_members: index constituents through the core index recipe. Prefer this over generic BDS/BQL members when the user asks for constituents.",
  "- xbbg_resolve_isins: resolves supplied ISIN strings to Bloomberg securities. Pass raw ISIN strings only for this recipe; otherwise use /isin/<ISIN> syntax with data tools.",
  "- xbbg_issuer_isins: issuer/bond ISIN workflow for supplied bond ISIN strings.",
  "- xbbg_etf_holdings: ETF holdings recipe for a single ETF ticker. Prefer this over generic BQL holdings when the user asks for ETF constituents.",
  "- xbbg_stream_snapshot: bounded live market-data observation from //blp/mktdata. Requires explicit maxUpdates and always terminates/unsubscribes.",
  "- xbbg_mktbar_snapshot: bounded live market-bar observation from //blp/mktbar for one ticker. Requires explicit maxUpdates and always terminates/unsubscribes.",
  "- xbbg_depth_snapshot: bounded market-depth observation from //blp/mktdepthdata for one ticker. Requires explicit maxUpdates and always terminates/unsubscribes.",
  "",
  "## BQL guidance",
  "- BQL is a complete Bloomberg Query Language expression sent as one query string; the tool does not assemble get/for/with clauses for you.",
  "- Basic shape: get(<FIELD_1>, <FIELD_2>) for(<UNIVERSE>). Use placeholders such as '<TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>', holdings('<ETF_TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>'), or members('<INDEX_TICKER> <MARKET_SECTOR>') until the user supplies real inputs.",
  "- Use BQL for universe-oriented analytics and screens only when the user provides a bounded universe, filters, and date range.",
  "- Prefer xbbg_ext_bql_builder instead of hand-writing BQL for supported workflows: preferred stocks, corporate bonds, and ETF holdings.",
  "- Do not use BQL just because the user asks for normal reference data; xbbg_bdp is simpler for current fields and xbbg_bdh is simpler for historical time series.",
  "",
  "## Output handling",
  "- Tool results use LangChain content_and_artifact output: content starts with a compact summary and then includes bounded model-readable JSON; artifact is the structured bounded envelope with tool, rowCount, truncated, and data for application code.",
  "- If a response is empty, truncated, or contains Bloomberg/security errors, say that directly. Do not fill gaps from memory or assumptions.",
] as const;

const OPTIONAL_EXTENSION_INSTRUCTIONS = [
  "",
  "## Extension helper tools",
  "- xbbg_ext_ticker: ticker hygiene before live calls. parse_ticker splits a Bloomberg ticker, normalize_tickers trims/canonicalizes lists, filter_equity_tickers keeps equity-like tickers, is_specific_contract checks futures specificity, and validate_generic_ticker rejects malformed generic futures tickers.",
  "- xbbg_ext_futures: futures contract construction and selection. Use build_futures_ticker for root/month/year/asset assembly, get_futures_months for month-code lookup, generate_candidates for generic-to-specific candidates, contract_index for generic contract rank, filter_candidates_by_cycle for HMUZ/quarterly cycles, and filter_valid_contracts to keep contracts valid for a date.",
  "- xbbg_ext_cdx: CDX ticker workflow support. Use parse_cdx_ticker to understand a CDX ticker, previous_cdx_series to roll back a series, cdx_gen_to_specific to resolve a generic CDX to a target series, and cdx_info/cdx_pricing/cdx_risk for predefined BDP field bundles. cdx_pricing and cdx_risk accept recoveryRate, which becomes the CDS_RR override.",
  "- xbbg_ext_currency: currency-planning helpers. build_fx_pair constructs the Bloomberg FX pair and conversion factor, same_currency avoids unnecessary conversion, and currencies_needing_conversion identifies which currencies differ from a target before requesting converted values.",
  "- xbbg_ext_bql_builder: safe BQL generators for common xbbg workflows. Use build_preferreds_query for preferred-stock discovery from an equity, build_corporate_bonds_query for company bond universes with optional currency/active filters, and build_etf_holdings_query for ETF constituents. Prefer these builders over hand-writing those BQL shapes.",
  "- xbbg_ext_market_session: exchange calendar/timezone support. derive_sessions turns day session times into session blocks, infer_timezone maps country codes to timezones, session_times_to_utc converts local sessions to UTC, get_market_rule gets MIC/exchange rules, default_turnover_dates and default_bqr_datetimes provide bounded defaults, and get/list_exchange_override inspect configured exchange metadata.",
  "- xbbg_ext_yas_overrides: builds flat YAS override maps for fixed-income BDP requests when the lower-level BDP workflow is required. Prefer xbbg_yas for actual YAS recipe fields.",
  "- xbbg_ext_constants: static lookup/format helpers for date parsing/formatting, futures month code/name mappings, dividend type mappings, and known dividend/ETF output columns.",
  "- xbbg_ext_columns: post-processing helpers for Bloomberg-shaped tables. Use rename_dividend_columns, rename_etf_columns, or build_earning_header_rename when explaining or normalizing response column names after a request.",
  "- xbbg_ext_calculate: small numeric helper for Bloomberg workflows. calculate_level_percentages pairs observed values with levels; values and levels must have the same length.",
