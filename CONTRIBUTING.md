# Contributing to xbbg

Thank you for your interest in contributing to xbbg!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Rust 1.75+
- [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) (recommended) or pip
- Bloomberg C++ SDK (for building the Rust backend)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alpha-xone/xbbg.git
   cd xbbg
   ```

2. Set up the Bloomberg SDK:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   bash ./scripts/sdktool.sh

   # Windows PowerShell
   # .\scripts\sdktool.ps1
   ```

3. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   pixi install && pixi run install
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pixi run test
   ```

### Bloomberg SDK Compatibility

The minimum supported Bloomberg C SDK version is defined in
`defs/bloomberg.toml` (`min_sdk_version`). If you add a dependency on a new
`blpapi_*` function or type, verify it exists in the minimum version:

```bash
# Check against min SDK (reads defs/bloomberg.toml)
bash scripts/abi-check.sh

# Check against specific versions
bash scripts/abi-check.sh --versions "3.24.6.1 3.26.2.1"
```

CI runs this automatically as the **ABI Compat** job.

## Code Style

### Python
- We use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- Run `pixi run lint` before committing

### Rust
- Run `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` for linting
